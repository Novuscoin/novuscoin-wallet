## Some words about safety of your novuscoins
* novuscoins in novuscoin Wallet are stored on the device.
* **If you lose your device, you'll lose your novuscoins.**  Just like money in your physical wallet.
* **Before uninstalling novuscoin Wallet** (or clearing app data/wiping your device), **transfer your novuscoins to another wallet**. Any remaining Novuscoins will be lost.
* **Transactions cannot be undone!** If you send your novuscoins into the void, there is no way to get them back unless you know the receiver and she is willing to send them back.
* **Keep your mobile device safe!** Do only install apps you fully trust.  Malicious apps could be trying to steal your wallet.
